//MODULE ASSIGNMENT 2 - LEVEL 1

1. What is a function literal?
A function literal is an expression that produces a new function object.

2. What is the constructor?
A constructor is sort of a template for objects, similar to both not the same as classes in other languages.

3. What does the return statement do?
Returns a value from a function or breaks / stops and exits the function returning undefined

4. What will be written to the console from this function:
		function myFunction(){
			  return console.log('inside my function');
			  console.log('My name is Andy');
		}
		myFunction();
"inside my function" will be logged to console, because return exits the function with the console.log value before the second console.log is run.

5. Briefly describe scope in JavaScript.
Scope is how far something reaches, similar to something in the world being global, local, international, or even intergalactic. Like if a law is passed in France, then it will (most likely) not affect Germany, but if a law is passed in the EU it will affect France and Germany. The same regarding variables, being in the global or local scope.
