// What is the DOM?
- DOM stands for Document Object Model
- It is a model that lets you manipulate objects in the document

// List three methods to manipulate the DOM.
- document.getElementById('');
- document.getElemetsByTagName('');
- document.querySelector('');

// What is an asynchronous call?
Asynchronous means starting something now then finishing it later.
It does not "block" the code, but only initiates.

// Briefly explain what the sources tab in Chromes Developers Tools does.
- It's like an explorer for the sources of the code, allowing you to view the "tree" / hierarchy and edit / save files
- It also allows you to create small "snippets": small pieces of code, easily accessed to be reused.

// What is a JavaScript promise?
A javascript promise is an object that represents an action that has not yet finished, but will at some point.
Like a regular promise in real life, it is pending until it's fulfilled or rejected, then it's settled.

// What is an API?
- Short for Application Programming Interface
- A way to serve data

// What is a JavaScript Event?
- A javascript event occurs when the user or browser does something to the page (clicking, hovering, loading, etc)
- Javascript can listen to these events and react when they are triggered

// What is event bubbling?
- Event Bubbling first happens on an element then on it's parents and up to it's ancestors. (Bubbles upwards)
- Event capturing moves from the top and down, from document > body > main > div > a > span,
  but event bubbling moves upwards, from span > a > div > main > body > document
- It can trigger unwanted behavior by running on a parent when supposed to run on the child element, and can be stopped.
